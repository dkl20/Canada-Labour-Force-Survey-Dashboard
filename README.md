# Canada-Labour-Force-Survey-Dashboard

This Tableau dashboard analyzes the relationship between post-secondary education and wages across Canada (2019-2024) to answer: **"Does post-secondary education increase future hourly wages and financial stability for high-school students and young adults, even during fluctuating macro-environmental events such as COVID-19?"**

## Data

- **Source:** Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey (February editions)
- **Period:** 2019-2024 (Pre-COVID, During COVID, Post-COVID)
- **Variables:** Hourly wage, education level, age group, province, industry (21 major sectors)

## Visualizations

- **Geographic maps** - Average wages by province across three time periods with education level filtering
- **Bar charts** - Wage comparison by education level and age group, tracking wage premiums over time
- **Industry analysis** - Highest-paying sectors for different education levels across 21 major industries

## Findings

With the rising cost of living in Canada, especially in recent years, the decision to pursue post-secondary education is more important than ever for high school students and young adults. They often have questions such as "Does a degree really matter?" and "Is post-secondary education worth the cost?"

The historical sentiment in much of the Western World, and particularly in Canada, is that pursuing post-secondary education leads to higher wages. In 2021, a study by Statistics Canada reported that 57.5% of adults aged 25 to 64 held a college or university credential (Statistics Canada, 2022).

In response, three visualizations were created to aid decision-makers in navigating the choice to pursue post-secondary education and make productive, data-driven decisions. The visualizations led to the conclusion that **despite fluctuations in the macroeconomic landscape, such as COVID-19, obtaining post-secondary education still leads to improved financial stability**.

### Data Analysis

To explore this theme, data from the February editions of the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey from 2019 to 2024 was obtained and analyzed. The dataset recorded variables such as industry, hourly wage, education level, age group, and more, from Canadian workers throughout three main periods: pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID.

### Key Findings by Visualization

#### 1. Geographic Analysis
The first visualization consists of three geographical maps of Canada for the years 2019 (pre-COVID), 2021 (during COVID), and 2024 (post-COVID) to account for wage fluctuations. The dataset was used to calculate average wages for each respective year and was filtered by education level, selecting the lowest level - high school education - to find the average wage for each province without post-secondary education.

**Key Finding:** Having any level of post-secondary education was associated with significantly higher wages in all years across all provinces.

- **Example:** British Columbia's average wage post-COVID-19:
  - No post-secondary education: $26.17
  - Some post-secondary education and beyond: $37.07

#### 2. Education Level & Age Group Analysis
The second visualization analyzed hourly wages for different levels of education, from high school to post-graduate, sorted by age group. Emphasis was placed on analyzing whether career seniority would close the wage gap between education levels, and examining the effects of COVID-19 and inflation on average wage levels.

**Key Finding:** Before, during, and after the pandemic, those with a bachelor's degree made higher wages on average, and the wage difference between education levels did not close with age/seniority.

- **Example:** In 2024, workers aged 35-39 with high school diplomas earned $32.01/hour vs. $43.46/hour for those with bachelor's degrees (36% wage premium).

#### 3. Industry Analysis
The final visualization, a series of bar charts, analyzed the average hourly wage based on 21 major industries identified by the Canadian Labour Force Survey and compared how education affected wages in top industries.

**Key Finding:** The top-paying industries in Canada are:
1. Utilities
2. Professional, scientific and technical services  
3. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction

For high school graduates specifically, the top-paying industries are:
1. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction
2. Forestry and logging and support activities for forestry
3. Public administration

While higher education continued to correlate with higher average wages (10-20% premium even within top industries), students without post-secondary education should consider these industries if they desire the highest average wages.
